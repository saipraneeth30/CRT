        <h2>Choose your favorite fruit</h2>
        <p>Fruits are natureâ€™s sweet and nutritious gifts, packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that support a healthy lifestyle. 
        They come in a wide variety of flavors, colors, and textures, ranging from juicy apples and oranges to soft bananas and berries. Many fruits, such as mangoes, papayas, and pineapples, are rich in vitamin C,
        which helps boost the immune system. Others, like avocados and olives, offer healthy fats that are good for the heart. Including a mix of fresh fruits
        in your daily diet not only enhances taste but also contributes to overall well-being and energy. </p>
